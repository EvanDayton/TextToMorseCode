# TextToMorseCode

// Morse Code Converter

// The Morse Code Converter is a simple web application that allows you to convert text to Morse code and vice versa. 
// Additionally, it provides the functionality to play the Morse code as audio signals for better understanding and practice. 
// This project is a practical tool for anyone interested in Morse code communication or learning.

// Features

    Text to Morse Code Conversion: Enter any text, and the application will convert it into Morse code. Each character is represented by a combination of dots (.) and dashes (-).

    Morse Code to Text Conversion: Input Morse code, and the application will decode it into plain text. Morse code symbols are separated by spaces, and words are separated by slash (/) to ensure proper word spacing.

    Audio Playback: The application includes a "Play Morse Code" button that allows you to hear the Morse code. The timing of dots, dashes, and spaces adheres to Morse code standards, making it a valuable learning tool.

    Conversion Options: Choose between text-to-Morse or Morse-to-text conversion based on your input.
